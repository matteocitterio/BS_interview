The one contained in `GeneticAlgorithm.cpp` is the code for a method of the class GeneticAlgorithm. The latter was part of a broader project where the goal was to create a code that was able of exploiting the properties of a genetic algorithm (i.e. to evolve a solution to a problem through mutations and updates, mimicking what happens with chromosomes) to find an optimal solution to an hard combinatorial problem (TSP, travel salesman problem).
